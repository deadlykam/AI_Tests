# AI_Tests
This is the AI pathfinder for non grid world. I have uploaded the entire project. You can see the AI perform from the Game View
or the scene view. I will later give options for changing the camera view.

To make obstacles for the AI just copy the 'Ctrl + D' the cubes already in the game or just make a new GameObject and change the layer to Obstacles.

K Out!
